Abstract:
In this study, non-verbal behavior in diversely-skilled groups was observed while participating in a collaborative educational game with a humanoid robot. Research has indicated that a mediating robot gaze can equalize the verbal contributions from each differently skilled participant, promoting inclusion and learning. The experiment results were further analyzed, extending to non-verbal effects. The initial results from two experiments under different robot gaze behavior indicate that modifications in the robot gaze can lead to different gaze behavior in participants. It was observed that a gaze mediating behavior in the robot led to increased gaze change frequency among participants as well as more time spent mirroring the robot's gaze. These initial results show promise in how a robot can balance attention in a collaborative learning environment.
